## Description

Passwords. Everyone has one and everyone needs one to access various different systems. Whether it be logging into Facebook or access a very secure server, it is best practice to have unique password that is difficult to replicate. The purpose of this project was to create application that would create a password utilizing criteria the user designated.

Key takeaways on this project were the utilization of functions, initializion of objects with properties, use of conditional logic to evaluate conditions, and implementation of loops to process actions. The application starts simply enough with asking how long the user wants to have the password and what kind of characters they want it to be comprised of (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, etc.). At least one is needed to generate the password so we implement validation logic to ensure the user follows the prompts correctly.

With all our choices in tow, an object is created continaing those choices as properties. Utilzing that object we are able to generate a password by checking the properties, loading the designated characters into an array and then random selecting characters to add to our password through a 'for' loop.

The end result is a password output to the screen for the user to view, copy/paste, and move about their business.
